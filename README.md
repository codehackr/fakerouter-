**THIS CODE FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**

For use with ESP8622 NodeMCU Microcontroller

Allows NodeMCU to emulate a WIFI wouter landing page in which user is asked for username and password to access the internet. FakeRouter captures the username and password and stores the data on microcontroller local memory which can later be accessed through a hidden admin web page.
